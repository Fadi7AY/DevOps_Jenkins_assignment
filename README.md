# 🚀 Jenkins_SAP 

📘 Extra Explanation on the Task

The goal of the assignment was to set up Jenkins in Docker, configuring persistence, adding an external agent, and running a simple pipeline.

## **Jenkins Controller in Docker**

Runs as a container with its data directory (/var/jenkins_home) mapped to a named volume (jenkins_home).

This ensures all jobs, plugins, and configuration survive container restarts or re-creation.

## **Dedicated Agent in Docker**

A second container (jenkins/inbound-agent) was launched and connected to the controller using a secret.

It runs builds on a mounted volume (agent1_workdir) so its workspace persists across restarts.

The controller and agent communicate over a custom Docker network (jenkins-net).

## **Pipeline**

Defined in Jenkinsfile.

Uses a label to target the external agent (linux-docker-extra).

Stages:

**Info:** prints details about the running node/agent at the start of the build, using Jenkins environment variables

**Checkout:** pulls code from SCM

**Run:** executes scripts/hello.sh "$NAME", which creates output.txt containing the current date, Git commit SHA, and user-provided name.

**Archive:** saves output.txt as a build artifact and fingerprints it for traceability.

## **SCM Integration**

Configured to poll the GitHub repo every ~2 minutes (H/2 * * * *).

## **Persistence**

Controller state is preserved in jenkins_home volume.

Agent workspace persists in agent1_workdir volume.

Restarting either container does not lose configuration or job history.

---

**Pipeline summary:** prints details about the running node/agent , checks out from Git, runs `scripts/hello.sh "$NAME"` to create `output.txt`, prints it
and archives it as an artifact (with fingerprint).


**SCM polling:** `H/2 * * * *` (checks ~every 2 min for changes , if it spots any , the pipeline executes).

## ⚙️ Jenkins Controller + Agent (Docker Setup)

### 🏗️ Step 1: Create Persistent Volumes
```bash
docker volume create jenkins_home
docker volume create agent1_workdir
```

### 🌐 Step 2: Create a Private Docker Network
```bash
docker network create jenkins-net
```

### 📦 Step 3: Run the Jenkins Controller (LTS)
```bash
docker run -d --name jenkins \
  --network jenkins-net \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

🔗 Access Jenkins UI: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
🔑 Get initial admin password:
```bash
docker logs jenkins 2>&1 | grep -A2 "Please use the following password"
```

### 🖥️ Step 4: Configure Agent Node in Jenkins UI
1. Go to **Manage Jenkins → Nodes → New Node**  
2. Node type: **Permanent Agent**  
3. Remote root directory: `/home/jenkins/agent`  
4. Launch method: **Launch agent by connecting it to the controller (inbound)**  
5. Save → copy the **Node Secret**

### 🤖 Step 5: Run the Inbound Agent Container
```bash
docker run -d --name jenkins-agent-1 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network jenkins-net \
  -e JENKINS_URL="http://jenkins:8080" \
  -e JENKINS_AGENT_NAME="linux-docker-1" \
  -e JENKINS_SECRET="NODE_SECRET" \
  -e JENKINS_AGENT_WORKDIR="/home/jenkins/agent" \
  -v agent1_workdir:/home/jenkins/agent \
  jenkins/inbound-agent:latest
```

🔑 Credentials Handling

**If repo is public , No credentials required (as in this case)**

No secrets are hardcoded in the repository or Jenkinsfile.

If the GitHub repo were private, credentials would be added in Manage Jenkins → Credentials:

HTTPS: Username + Personal Access Token

SSH: SSH private key

In jobs, these credentials are referenced by their ID, never exposed in source control or console logs.

The agent secret used to connect linux-docker-1 is generated by Jenkins automatically and passed as an environment variable to the agent container. It is not committed to the repo.

---
### 🎯 Q1. If you kill the Jenkins container, what command do you use to start it again with the same configuration? 🎯

A: if the container was stopped I use this command : 
```bash 
docker start jenkins
```
This starts the same container with its persistent data from jenkins_home.

and if the container is removed , this command is used :

```bash
docker run -d --name jenkins \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts

```
by this , the container will take the data that was saved by the previous container on my local volume (jenkins_home)

---

### 🎯 Q2. Why does Jenkins preserve its state after restart? 🎯

A: Because Jenkins stores all its configuration, jobs, plugins, and history in /var/jenkins_home. In Docker, this path is mapped to the named volume 

jenkins_home, which persists independently of the container (the jenkins_home is local on my pc , so the data is always accessible by other containers , 

even if a new one was created , it just must be connected to the volume).

🏆 Bonus Section – Dedicated Linux Agent

🔧 What I Did:

Created a new node in Jenkins UI:

Name: linux-docker-1

Remote root directory: /home/jenkins/agent

Label: linux-docker-extra

Launch method: Inbound agent with secret

Created a Docker network so the agent and controller can talk:
```bash
docker network create jenkins-net
docker network connect jenkins-net jenkins
```

Started the agent container with the official inbound agent image:
```bash
docker run -d --name jenkins-agent-1 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network jenkins-net \
  -e JENKINS_URL="http://jenkins:8080" \
  -e JENKINS_AGENT_NAME="linux-docker-1" \
  -e JENKINS_SECRET="NODE_SECRET" \
  -e JENKINS_AGENT_WORKDIR="/home/jenkins/agent" \
  -v agent1_workdir:/home/jenkins/agent \
  jenkins/inbound-agent:latest
```

Modified the Jenkinsfile to target the agent by label:
```bash
agent { label 'linux-docker-extra' }
```

Ran the pipeline — it executed on the agent and archived output.txt.
